# Overview - ThingsStats

This is a set of tools to analyze your [Things](https://culturedcode.com/things/) data. It is currently a work in progress but some goals are to generate reports that tell you how many tasks you have completed, how many you have uncompleted, and break it down further by project. Additionally, the tools will allow you to see your oldest outstanding tasks and add new ones to a daily tracker.

# How To Use

Because this project is in development you can use it by cloning the repo, installing the dependencies, and running it with `python ./src/main.py`.
